# Random Colour Picker
## Project #44 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
This ReactJS app displays a randomised colour and its RGB values every time the app's button is clicked. 
## What I Learned
  - Importing and exporting components to allow interaction
  - Storing the component as state
  - Rendering component instances
  - Using event handlers within JSX
  - Binding methods that use "this" to the constructor
  - Passing props between components
